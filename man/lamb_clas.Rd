\usage{
lamb_clas(points, slp)
}
\arguments{
\item{mslp}{3-Dimensional multi-array ([loni,lati,time]) with mean sea level pressure in Pa.}

\item{grid16}{Data frame obtained in the main function (extended_jc) that contains the 16 grid-points defining the scheme.
First row is for longitudes, while the second row is for latitudes.}

\item{centralp}{Numeric that refers to the central point for which the JC classification is calculated.}

\item{loni}{Array with longitude values.}

\item{lati}{Array with latitude values.}

\item{times}{Array with the dates used.}

\item{gale}{A logical for deteriming Gale days.}
}
\value{
Daily frequencies of Weather Types and airflow indices.
}
\description{
Calculates the classification of the main weather types
             for one central point that is surrounded by 16-points (grid16). Wind-flow characteristics
             are computed for the daily pressure field according to the rules proposed by the original
             Jenkinson and Collison classification (see Jones et al. 1993, Jones et al. 2016).
